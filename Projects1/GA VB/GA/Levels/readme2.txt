APE Levels
==========

Each level has 2 files which make up the level. A map file, which contains all of the map tile places (Which must follow the pattern level*.txt), and another file which at the moment only contains the name of the MIDI file which accompanies the level (Which must follow the pattern level*def.txt). Later on in the development of the APE, this file will contain sprite data for the level (Where each sprite is, is it a static bitmap or animated? How many frames? Delay between each frame? Is the sprite a bad guy? If so, where can he move?).
